At the front-end when creating an event it will be necessary to create an array of JSON sports objects that will be passed along with the other event attributes.
Also for the creation/deletion of sports etc you will have to use the requisite middleware as present in the middleware. Consequently, whereas sports is a part of events, modfication to the sports array will be done using the "/sports" instead of "/events".
